Assume that we are building a parking app for SF city and we need two API's.

Build the following REST APIs. (choose Django or Flask)

1. REST API to list all available parking spots. Input params: {lat, lng, radius}
2. REST API to reserve an available parking spot. input params: { parking_spot, time-range }


Optional:
- test cases for the API's
- view existing reservations
- cancel existing reservations
- extend existing reservations.

Please host the code in a git repo and share the link with me.

Thanks,
Jason
