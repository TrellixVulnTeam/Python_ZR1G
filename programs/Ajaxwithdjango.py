This tutorial demonstrates implementing Ajax in Django, using JQuery, for two specific tasks:
1.A search box that executes on each key press.
2.A like button that says "yes" if it’s liked, and "no" if it’s not.
First we’ll create the website without Ajax, and then we’ll integrate the Ajax calls.

Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript + XML,
It describes a "new" approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including: HTML or XHTML,
Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, The Document Object Model, XML, XSLT, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object.
When these technologies are combined in the Ajax model, web applications are able to make quick, incremental updates to 
the user interface without reloading the entire browser page. This makes the application faster and more responsive to user actions.
Although X in Ajax stands for XML, JSON is used more than XML nowadays because of its many advantages such as being lighter 
and a part of JavaScript. Both JSON and XML are used for packaging information in Ajax model.
