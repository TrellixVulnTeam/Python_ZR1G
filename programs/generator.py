'''
python2:xrange() was a generator.
Generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later 
resume to pick up where it left off.
the generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and 
state around the last point of value generation
Generators are best for calculating large sets of results (particularly in calculations that 
involve loops themselves) 
in cases where we donâ€™t want to allocate the memory for all of the results at the same time.
the yield keyword at a function will cause the function to become a generator.
